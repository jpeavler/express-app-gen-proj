What type of resources can you host with Express?
    Websites with CRUD functionality.
What are the benefits of using a View Engine overusing Vanilla technologies?
    We can focus on the content of our website instead of the setup.
Why does the Express Generator split up the functionality into so many files?
    To leverage separation of concerns. If our visual display is off, we know
    it is our ejs files. If our data isn't as expected, we can check our files
    in our data folder. If our site isn't redirecting properly, we can check
    the routes folder.
